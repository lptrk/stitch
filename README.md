**Stitch** is a visual E2E workflow test runner that allows you to define, inspect, and execute Playwright-based test blocks through an intuitive UI. Built with Next.js and Playwright.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Drag & drop workflow builder with customizable test blocks
- Built-in support for Playwright and custom block chaining
- Debugging, inspection and headless execution modes
- Fully local or containerized execution supported

---

# üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started (Local)

> Requires: **Node.js ‚â• 18**, **pnpm**, and **Playwright**

## 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```
This installs dependencies for the main app as well as the test runner.

## 2. Install Playwright browsers
```bash
npx playwright install
```
This step is required for Playwright to function properly (downloads Chromium, etc.).

## 3. Start the application
```bash
pnpm dev
```
By default, the app runs on http://localhost:3000.

# üê≥ Running with Docker
Requires: Docker installed

## 1. Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t stitch-app .
```

## 2. Run the container
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 stitch-app
```
This will launch the app in production mode at http://localhost:3000.

üß™ Executing a Workflow
You can trigger workflow execution via the Stitch UI or directly through the test runner:

```bash
node runner/run-workflow.js workflows/example-with-chaining.json
```
In Docker:
```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> node runner/run-workflow.js workflows/example-with-chaining.json
```

> ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Vercel Can't Run Playwright Tests
>
> Vercel's infrastructure does **not allow installing or running browser engines**, which Playwright depends on.
>
> üö´ This means test execution (e.g. Chromium launch) **will not work** on Vercel.
>
> ### ‚úÖ Solution:
> - Use the provided **Docker setup** to run tests locally or in production
> - Or integrate with a **custom self-hosted runner** for executing workflows
